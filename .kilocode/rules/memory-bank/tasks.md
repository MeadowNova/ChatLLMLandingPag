## Marketing Copy Revision for Strategic Pivot

**Description:** Revise all landing page copy to align with the new strategic positioning and research insights.

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/app/page.tsx` (main landing page structure)
- `app/components/hero-section.tsx`
- `app/components/value-proposition-section.tsx`
- `app/components/features-section.tsx`
- `app/components/pricing-section.tsx`
- `app/components/final-cta-section.tsx`
- (and any other relevant UI components that contain marketing copy)

**Step-by-step Workflow:**
1.  **Understand Current Copy:** Review existing copy on the landing page components.
2.  **Define New Messaging Pillars:** Based on the strategic implications, outline the core messages for each section.
    *   Shift Narrative: From "Exploit Pricing Arbitrage" to "Launch Your AI Automation Chatbot Agency for SMBs."
    *   Highlight Value: Emphasize the "business-in-a-box" framework (templates, business acumen) as the core value.
    *   Transparency: Acknowledge Abacus AI limitations and position the course as a guide through these challenges, building trust.
    *   Target Market: Clearly define the focus on the SMB market.
    *   ROI Focus: Frame the course as an investment with clear ROI (e.g., landing first clients quickly).
    *   Community: Promote the value of the student community.
3.  **Draft New Copy (Section by Section):** Write new copy for each relevant component, incorporating the new narrative, value propositions, transparency, and ROI focus.
4.  **Review and Refine:** Ensure consistency, clarity, and alignment with the overall strategic pivot.
5.  **Implement Changes:** Apply the new copy to the actual files.

**Important Considerations/Gotchas:**
- Maintain a consistent tone and voice.
- Ensure all claims are supported by the research insights.
- Focus on benefits over features.
- Integrate calls to action effectively.

**Example of Completed Implementation:**
